      "text": "READING - Task 1: From London to Berlin - Irish author Naoise Dolan on moving to live in the German capital\n\nI moved to Berlin last summer from London, where I had essentially suffered a burnout, depression and emotional collapse. This explanation doesn't go well in small talk, so I tend to claim instead that I wanted a change of scene.\n\nAt the time, my debut novel had been published two years earlier and had gathered a lot of attention. That might sound like a dream come true – but over the months that followed, I was driven progressively more insane by my chronic inability to say no. I tried to be thankful for the flood of media requests and speaking invitations, endless interviews chat shows, Q&A sessions and other public appearances I was asked to make. But that just didn't work out. I never craved for all that attention. I told myself that most people would regard it as a nice problem to have. To me it turned into a nightmare.\n\nFor as long as I could, I denied that anything was wrong. Throughout my early years and adolescence, I found it difficult to communicate and form relationships. I was used to hiding my difficulties and neglecting my own wellbeing in an attempt not to burden others. I could never get used to quick changes and always stuck to my well-established daily patterns. There were definitely moments when I felt like I was on a completely different planet from the rest of the young.\n\nBut by early 2022, I could no longer even vaguely pretend to be holding things together. I struck the bottom when I couldn't sleep for three whole days, by the end of which my feet had swollen, I twitched at background noises and my own voice sounded as if it were coming from several meters away. After finally managing to sleep on the third night, I woke up sixteen hours later to several missed phone calls. Someone from my literary agency had come to a nearby coffee shop with a contract I urgently needed to sign, and had waited in vain for an hour. That was the turning point.\n\nExactly around that time, I visited an Irish friend in Berlin. At my first night in Berlin, I took the tram in the dark, carried my suitcase up the communal stairs in my friend's apartment building and slept more soundly on her small polyester couch than I ever had in my London double bed in the semi-detached house. In the morning I walked around the neighbourhood, enjoying the wide pavements and abundance of trees.\n\nConsider this January trip the first beat in my spiralling romance with Berlin. I returned in the spring to stay another few days and I moved that summer. It was a no brainer. I had no second thoughts about it. Relocating to Berlin has improved my mental health in two main ways. The first is that I'm less professionally overwhelmed. I'm asked to do fewer things now, since it's a hassle to bring me to London – and when I do feel swamped with work, I'm finding it easier to speak up. Daily exposure to German directness has cured me of my once-consuming need to be liked.\n\nBetter yet, learning German has toned-down my perfectionism. Many young Berliners instantly switch to English when they hear the slightest trace of any accent. At first I took this personally, interpreted each English response as a minus. Over time, I toughened up. Nowadays I rarely get hit with English – and when I do, I choose to see it as their own desire to practice. I asked my German friends \"Why do you reply in English to me if I've just spoken perfectly fine German?\" They were uniformly baffled that anyone could get upset. \"Of course\" they say \"you speak English with English-speakers – for us it's just a matter of politeness!\"\n\nDid I need to move to Berlin to get happy? Maybe not. But I needed to do something and this thing worked. I love writing again, love people, love being alive and learning words of the German-yet-unknown.",

There is one extra sentence which does not fit in any of the gaps.\n\nOn July 22, 2012, the Lena Pillars Nature Park became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. (1) _____. The park occupies more than a million hectares, with taiga, dunes, a full-flowing river, and bizarre rocks resembling an ancient Gothic castle or a sleeping dragon.\n\n(2) _____. They stand intermittently in a 40 kilometre wall along the right bank of the Lena River and the left bank of the Buotama, a nearly parallel tributary.\n\nIn fact, the spire-shaped rocks are remnants that survived the weathering of mountain ranges. (3) _____. The mountains that shaped the Lena Pillars began to form on the site of a once shallow sea that was lapping here, at the bottom of which limestone was gradually accumulating. (4) _____. For all these years nature has been taking a creative approach in shaping the Cambrian limestones using erosion and dramatic changes in temperature to form this impregnable wall.\n\n(5) _____. However, locals consider them to be frozen deities that are waiting for their time to come back to people. (6) _____. A young warrior fought the dragon to save a fair lady. The monster was almost defeated, but at the last moment it struck the ground with its tail and turned everything and everybody into stone.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that researchers managed to find an early man site in the park that is about 370,000 years old, as well as the remains of a mammoth, an ancient bison, and a woolly rhinoceros. (7) _____. The real paleontological treasure of the park is the fossils found there, with ancient invertebrates preserved in them.\n\nToday the diversity of flora and fauna of the national park cannot but amaze. There are about 500 species of plants, 42 species of mammals, more than a hundred species of nesting birds, a huge number of fish and many reptiles. (8) _____. Unique Ust-Buotama Farm aims to restore the population of these rare animals that are on the IUCN Red List. (9) _____. On the territory of the national park, there are many lakes with a depth of two to three meters, formed both in natural relief depressions and on flat watersheds. They are filled with water due to rainfall. (10) _____. Their shores are usually flat, and in winter both the shores and floors of the lakes are usually frozen.",

If a line is correct put 'V'. If a line has a word which should not be there, write the word.\n\nAdvertising will change profoundly over the next couple of decades, although there's a good chance you won't notice the difference, since the most meaningful changes won't be visible to the casual observer.\nIt's the changes that are happening underground that will count, and they're the ones we should be aware of. Advertising in the future will be such stealthily and eerily, targeted, disturbingly omnipresent and inescapable.\nTechnology, naturally, will be the engine. User-tracking software that records your TV and Internet viewing habits in minute detail - and crosses it with your purchasing history - will allow the advertiser to know that you have children, that you eat meat, that your native tongue is Spanish and that your dishwasher is however far many years old.\nThat way you will be shown commercials for mini-vans, cheeseburgers, and replacement dishwashers, all in Spanish, and not for sports cars, tofu and replacement refrigerators, in English. In fact, this technology already exists. Refined with data that track what kinds of online ads you tend to click on – funny, sentimental, fact-laden – every commercial will have hit home.\nSay what you will, that's a nifty trick. In the future, people won't be bothered with advertising messages irrelevant to them. They'll tend to like advertising too better because it's so carefully tailored to their tastes and will begin to feel less like an intrusion.\nThis works for the advertiser too because fewer dollars will be wasted. While it's a little dispiriting to think we can be so predictably manipulated, maybe that's a fair price to pay to avoid the pollution of messages you don't care about.\nNevertheless, it seems clear that the advertising outlets that exist today - TV and audio commercials, prints ads, billboards and taxi tops – will be inadequate for accommodating all the commercial messages that are agitating to get out of.\nAdvertising will therefore inevitably slip beyond within the boundaries of the 30-second commercial and the full-page ad and migrate to the rest of the world, including entertainment, journalism and art.\nYou can glimpse the future now. A product placement in movies is an obvious instance of where advertising has slipped outside its traditional container into entertainment.\nThe music channels which are an entertainment medium designed specially to sell records are another classic example. Every time an artist mentions a brand in their lyrics, advertising slips into art.\nIt you have a tattoo of your team's name, you're already there. If you wear a T-shirt with a logo on it, you're also there but with less pain. Eventually, every surface that can display a message will be made appropriated for advertising.\nA backlash is inevitable. Perhaps people will be pay a premium to live in advertising-free zones.\nPeople get very nervous when they see the line being blurring between advertising and other forms of content; they think advertising is some kind of infection that pollutes the purity of art, ruins objectivity and distracts from the pleasure of entertainment.\nYet this is missing the point. Surely consumers are smart and perfectly aware of when they're being sold something; surely people who go to company websites are happy to find worthwhile information there and are capable of distinguishing between a commercial message and an editorial one.\nIn the main, art and journalism have long relied on direct subsidy from private sources. Don't think for a minute that commercial interests didn't enter into it.\nThe genuinely disturbing aspect remains of advertising is that it has begun to take over what was formally the property of the community. Take, for example, the popular Boston Garden park, naturally named after the city. It is now known as the \"Fleet Center\", after the sponsoring bank. A little town in the Pacific Northwest just renamed itself after a dotcom company in return for a generous denotation.\nI won't mention the name here, since I figure advertising should be paid for it. That's when advertising has gone too far: when it's become something we are, rather than something we see.",
