      "text": "<h3>The openness of talking to strangers</h3>\n<p><i>Catherine Carr shares her experience of talking to strangers.</i></p>\n<p>You may be surprised to learn that one of my ideas of top entertainment is to people-watch. You’ll find me at it in cafés, bars, on trains. The only thing that can beat it is to take the extra step and strike up a conversation. Not the party kind one. I prefer the bigger sort, with feelings and explanations of passions, maybe with a bit of childhood thrown in.</p>\n<p>Early on in my career as a radio reporter, this preference for the personal over the professional was obvious. I didn’t make the greatest of newshounds, as I was often completely diverted by the lives which surrounded the headline. Often, after switching off the recorder, instead of hurrying back to file my piece, I ended up chatting some more and more.</p>\n<p>Some time later, I moved to Colchester and started recording my podcast, <i>Where Are You Going?</i> Its concept is simple: I potter around any location talking to strangers and asking them that question. The answers are sometimes funny, sometimes surprising, tragic or shocking. Occasionally they take your breath away. On one single sunny day, for instance, I recorded interviews with an artist in a fluffy orange cardigan, a pair of retired special needs teachers on their way to buy ice-creams, and a trio of Iranian refugees.</p>\n<p>Or, I remember a hot September lunchtime, when I started talking to a man I have never met before. He was on the way to Boots and he told me he’d been married for years and was currently waiting for a hip replacement. He played in a rock band that performed all over Essex. He then told me how his Italian father had met his English mother. His parents’ marriage was a happy one and the story was precious to him. He told me about his trips to Tuscany and lovely meetings he had with the Italian relatives.</p>\n<p>This September, the podcast won an award at the British Podcast Awards and lots of listeners tell us they have found a blueprint for creating connections of their own, understanding it can be quite possible to talk to people you don’t know and share a little of each other’s lives.</p>\n<p>In his fascinating book <i>Hello, Stranger</i> writer William Buckingham writes that there is something freeing and comfortable in talking to strangers, in the possibilities they bring. Strangers are unentangled in our worlds and lives and this lack can lighten our own burden. This is why strangers can unexpectedly become confidants.</p>\n",

      "text": "<p><strong>READING — Task 2</strong></p>\n<p>Tsvetaeva apple pie (tsvetaevski pirog) is a neat little dessert familiar to both Russian home bakers and poetry lovers. One of the unofficial stories has it that the pie was loved by the family of Marina Tsvetaeva and often baked and served by Marina and her sister Anastasia at tea time, when they were young ladies and spent their holidays and summers at a dacha in Tarusa with relatives and closest friends. In reality, there is no paper trail to confirm this story. She admitted she was generally hopeless and awful at cooking and housekeeping, too.</p>\n<p>In her memoirs, Anastasia recalls a large cozy garden with apple trees and a veranda. Indeed, sour cream was and is the most important ingredient of the pie, along with apples. That is why Russian fans of Tsvetaeva's poetry usually celebrate her birthday by making her favorite apple pie.</p>\n<p>In fact, adding sour cream into the dough makes the piecrust tenderer and richer in taste. And the same goes with the filling. Some say that sour cream is a good Slavic alternative to cream cheese. The best apple varieties for Tsvetaeva apple pie are Antonovka or Bogatyr, which can be picked in late autumn. Although the traditional version of the pie calls for apples, sour cream base also goes perfectly with lots of other fruits and especially berries. So why not try adding strawberries into the recipe, the most summerish berries? The pie is equally delicious when served warm or cooled. Enjoy a slice with a cup of black tea!</p>\n",

Items 1–15 (15 points)</strong></p>\n<p>For questions 1–15, read the text below and look carefully at each line. Some of the lines are correct, and some have a word which should not be there. If a line is correct put a tick. Use letter \"V\" as a tick. If a line has a word which should not be there, write the word in a given space. There are two examples at the beginning (0 and 00).</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I improve my conversation skills?</strong></p>\n\n<p>0\nI’m ignored when I try to chat to people. How do you do conversation? I don’t understand how it works. I can only ever communicate factual information such as “A coffee and a croissant, please.”\nV</p>\n\n<p>00\nOther people seem to rattle on about anything and everything, constantly jumping from one topic to another, but I can never follow. If I ever feel that I have something to contribute and try to join in they simply ignore me or change the latter subject.\n</p>\n\n<p>1\nIf I will try to initiate a conversation, for example by complimenting someone on their obviously expensive camera, they will initially respond but after about 60 seconds turn away as soon as they realise that I am “trying to make conversation”.</p>\n\n<p>2\nOn the other one hand, I am able to express myself very well in writing. Even more paradoxically I make a good living as a translator (in written form), translating from various European languages.</p>\n\n<p>3\nPartly this is because I take a very analytical approach to language and so I am able to dig too deep into the meaning of what the writer is trying to convey.</p>\n\n<p>4\nI also get along very well with animals, using a body language. For instance, I can get dogs to follow me around, walk to heel, sit or lie down merely by using gestures.</p>\n\n<p>5\nBut it would be far nice to take my conversational skills a little bit higher. Any tips? Quite a lot of people aren’t as skilled at conversation as they think, so you are not alone. What’s great is that you are curious and asking the question.</p>\n\n<p>6\nSome people are being stuck on transmit (“rambling”) and think talking about themselves is good chat. Some think interrogating the other person is the way to go. But conversation is the turning together of two people. A lot of people mistake talking for conversation.</p>\n\n<p>7\nI wouldn’t necessarily always blame yourself either; a fruitful conversation does it require input from two people, not just one left doing the heavy lifting.</p>\n\n<p>8\nI went to psychotherapist and skilled conversationalist Chris Mills with whom I did a podcast on the art of listening which is a great bedrock of conversation.</p>\n\n<p>9\nMills pondered on at “the difference between small talk and delivering factual information. The fundamental for a conversation to be successful is that it has to make emotional contact and a list of facts (“croissant and coffee”) on their own won’t do that. It has to have emotional zing.”</p>\n\n<p>10\nSo to layer on what you already do you could add, “the croissants look great – do you make them here?” or “this coffee hits the spot, what a blend is it?”</p>\n\n<p>11\nThese things won’t trigger a massive conversation because baristas often have a queue to serve over, but they are stepping stones and good practice points.</p>\n\n<p>12\nWe also have had to be realistic about how far some conversations, in certain settings, can go. I think it’s entirely realistic that after 60 seconds someone will call time on talking about a camera. Even the most skilled conversationalist would struggle.</p>\n\n<p>13\nThat said by some people need fewer triggers. Some spill more slowly. Being interested and curious – which you clearly are – is a great springboard for conversation; we are after all hard-wired for connection.</p>\n\n<p>14\n“To have a conversation you have to be able to imagine how what you’re saying is going to land with the other person. And that takes after empathy,” says Mills. Observation is also a great tool for conversation: just hearing what others talk about. There’s a reason talking about the weather is a stalwart in so many countries. It’s a connection, it’s non-committal, it’s not too personal and you can test the water with the other person.</p>\n\n<p>15\nBut like I am said, you have to be realistic. Some conversations will never go beyond a few exchanges. Listen carefully to what people are saying and instead of facts maybe think about feelings. So if someone says, “We’re going on holiday to X” try something like “have you ever been before? Are you excited about going?” Good luck!</p>\n",
