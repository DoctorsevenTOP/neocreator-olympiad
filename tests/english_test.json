The book gathered significant attention, leading to numerous media requests and public appearances that she struggled to refuse. Throughout her early years, she had difficulties with communication and forming relationships, preferring established routines. By early 2022, her condition worsened dramatically - she couldn't sleep for three days, experienced physical symptoms, and missed an important contract signing. \n\nDuring a visit to an Irish friend in Berlin, she slept soundly on a small couch and enjoyed the neighbourhood's wide pavements and trees. This January trip sparked her romance with Berlin, and she moved there that summer. The relocation improved her mental health by reducing professional pressure and helping her become more direct. Learning German also reduced her perfectionism, as young Berliners often switched to English when hearing accents. Her German friends explained they replied in English out of politeness. The move helped Naoise rediscover her love for writing, people, and life.",

Некоторые строки правильные (поставьте V), в других есть лишнее слово (напишите это слово).\n\n[display-math]TEXT:[/display-math]\n\nAdvertising will change profoundly over the next couple of decades. The most meaningful changes won't be visible to casual observers - they're happening underground. Future advertising will be stealthily targeted, disturbingly omnipresent and inescapable. Technology will be the engine. User-tracking software recording TV and Internet habits will allow advertisers to know you have children, eat meat, speak Spanish, and have an old dishwasher. You'll see commercials for minivans, cheeseburgers, and replacement dishwashers in Spanish. This technology already exists. People won't be bothered with irrelevant messages and will like advertising better because it's tailored to their tastes. This works for advertisers too because fewer dollars are wasted. Maybe that's a fair price to avoid message pollution. Nevertheless, existing outlets like TV commercials, print ads, and billboards will be inadequate for all commercial messages. Advertising will therefore slip beyond commercial boundaries into entertainment, journalism and art. Product placement in movies is an obvious instance. Music channels designed to sell records are another example. Every time an artist mentions a brand, advertising slips into art. If you wear a logo T-shirt, you're already there. Eventually, every surface will be appropriated for advertising. A backlash is inevitable - perhaps people will pay a premium for advertising-free zones. People get nervous seeing the line blurred between advertising and other content. Yet consumers are smart and aware when they're being sold something. Art and journalism have long relied on private subsidies. The disturbing aspect is advertising taking over community property. Boston Garden park is now the Fleet Center after a sponsoring bank. A Pacific Northwest town renamed itself after a dotcom company for a generous donation. That's when advertising has gone too far - when it's become something we are rather than something we see.",
